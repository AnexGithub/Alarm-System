# created a Telegram bot for ESP32-CAM.
# Start a conversation with the ESP32-CAM bot.
# When we send the message /photo to the ESP32-CAM bot, the ESP32-CAM board receives the message, takes a new photo, and responds with that photo.
# We can send the message /flash to toggle the ESP32-CAMâ€™s LED flash.
# We can send the message /video to the ESP32-CAM bot, the ESP32-CAM board receives the message and it gives the address of the web server.
# We can send the /start message to receive a welcome message with the commands to control the board.
# The ESP32-CAM will only respond to messages coming from our Telegram account ID.
